        <h1>Designing a New 6-Stroke Cycle in a 4-Stroke ICE Using a Water-Vapor Bottoming Cycle</h1>
        <p class="muted">
          Implemented at the <strong>Shahrood University of Technology — Research Center</strong>.
          We re-timed a conventional 4-stroke spark-ignition engine and added two new
          water-injection/expansion strokes. The idea: after the standard power (combustion)
          stroke, <em>re-compress the hot exhaust gases</em> and inject high-pressure water.
          The water rapidly flashes/evaporates, expands, and delivers an <strong>additional
          power stroke</strong>. We designed and fabricated a custom <strong>timing (cam) shaft</strong>,
          a <strong>high-pressure water injection system</strong>, and a mobile <strong>test rig</strong> to evaluate the cycle.

      <!-- EXTENDED REPORT -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Extended technical report (non-proprietary)</h2>

        <h3>1) Thermodynamic cycle</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          The 6-stroke sequence modifies the gas exchange and adds a water-vapor bottoming loop:
          <strong>I</strong> Intake → <strong>II</strong> Compression → <strong>III</strong> Combustion/Power →
          <strong>IV</strong> Partial Exhaust (retain hot gases) →
          <strong>V</strong> Re-compression of trapped residuals →
          <strong>VI</strong> Water injection & steam expansion (second power stroke). The residual
          gas temperature after IV–V is leveraged to flash atomized water to vapor. Valve phasing
          is tuned to trap sufficient enthalpy while limiting pumping loss.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Valve timing & camshaft</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          We replaced the OEM cam with a <em>custom multi-profile shaft</em> to realize atypical
          hold-open/early-close events for the re-compression and water strokes. The design
          process included: (i) lobe-profile synthesis (dwell, ramp, jerk limits for follower
          survivability), (ii) bearing selection and seat drawings, (iii) CNC machining,
          (iv) assembly and run-out checks. Photos (below) show CAD, mechanical drawings,
          raw lobes, and the final shaft.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Water injection system</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          To achieve rapid vaporization, we employed high-pressure liquid injection with fine
          atomization. The system includes a plunger-type pump, accumulator, stainless lines,
          and a single-hole/mini-multihole injector. Injection is phased late in re-compression
          with the intake closed to maximize sensible heat transfer and minimize wall wetting.
          Nozzle targeting and droplet SMD were selected to avoid quench and to preserve wall films.
        </p>

        <h3>4) Controls & instrumentation</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          A simple phase controller synchronized cam angle, ignition, and water-pulse timing.
          On-engine sensors measured manifold pressure, crank speed, injector pressure, and
          exhaust temperature. The rolling rig allowed safe outdoor testing with radiator and
          cooling loop mounted on the frame.
        </p>

        <h3>5) Test observations</h3>
        <ul class="ticks">
          <li>Clean steam puffs observed during water-strokes at correct phasing and pressure.</li>
          <li>Measured torque rise during water-expansion compared to dry baseline at same throttle.</li>
          <li>Knock not observed due to water’s charge-cooling; peak exhaust temperature reduced.</li>
          <li>Key sensitivities: injector pressure & droplet size, re-compression pressure, and trapped residual mass.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6) Practical considerations</h3>
        <ul class="ticks">
          <li><strong>Materials:</strong> corrosion-resistant lines/nozzles; attention to water/oil separation.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal management:</strong> avoid cylinder wall quench; favor mid-chamber spray targeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety:</strong> high-pressure water line shielding; over-pressure relief; hot-surface spray protocols.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7) Status & outcomes</h3>
        <ul class="ticks">
          <li>Demonstrated feasibility on a small SI engine with custom timing hardware.</li>
          <li>Built a reusable research platform for further optimization (EGR fraction, multi-pulse, variable water rate).</li>
          <li>Documentation package: CAD, drawings, timing maps, and test logs.</li>
